# Sheepocalypse

----------------------------------------------
The goal of the game is to "survive" the sheepocalypse, this sheeps are crazy and they will kill any human around if they can, off course we are talking about you. 
Use the keyboard arrows to move.
There will be a red buttons that can be pressed by you or the sheeps to open or close the doors, you have to play with it to scape from the map.
If a sheep touches you, then you'll be dead. If that happens you'll have to restart from the begining by pressing the "retry" button.
The "pause" button is in the left-top of the screen.

So, thats it. Good luck out there.
